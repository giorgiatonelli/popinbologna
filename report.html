<h2> METHODOLOGY:</h2>
<p> A <b> top-down approach </b>has been adopted, meaning that we started from a general analysis concerning music genres in Bologna, we studied Italian pop bands as a whole, and then we focused on the <i> scena bolognese. </i> In doing so, we combined different tools. <br>
For instance, we conducted an analysis on musicians featured in the <b>MusicBo Catalogue </b> which we compared with the results obtained from using <b>DBpedia Snorql Queries</b> to find musicians from Bologna. Moreover, we used <b>Wikidata Query Service</b> to test our queries before retrieving data from <b>Melody</b>. On Melody we compared the number of Italian bands with bands from Bologna. Results showed that <b>2088 Italian bands</b> exist on Melody, whereas <b>0 bands</b> from Bologna are registered. We retrieved data about when were bands formed, a <b>diachronic approach</b> has therefore been adopted in order to investigate influential pop bands from Bologna, starting from the 60's. Pooh, Stadio, Lunapop and Lo Stato Sociale proved to be the most representative of their time. <b>Melody</b> proved to be an essential tool to illustrate the members of each band. When presenting bands on the website, we decided to include a link to their <b>Wikipedia</b> page, as well as a plug-in allowing us to play their music on <b>Spotify</b>. Moreover, a <b>timeline</b> concerning each of these bands discography has been included. Checkboxes concerning <b>a quiz</b> on each band have been featured on the website, in order to allow for an active reading of the article. 
<br> Moreover, <b>Melody map feature</b> proved essential in retrieving and visually representing data concerning recording studios and theatres. Not only, have theatres  been investigated further on Melody, by analysing theatres in Bologna, but a study on theatres has also been conducted on the <b>MusicBo catalogue</b>.
