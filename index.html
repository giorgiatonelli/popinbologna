Bologna is a <b>UNESCO heritage site</b> since 2006.

The <i>POLIFONIA</i> project is emblematic of Bologna key role in influencing both European and Italian music throughout centuries.

We interrogated the MusicBO corpus in order to learn who were the musicians featured on the corpus.

We also took inspiration from our daily lives in Bologna. We visited <b> Sala della Musica </b> in <i>Salaborsa</i> library.

<br>
Sala della musica exhibits the history of pop music in Bologna from the 1940s, thus <b>pop music</b> is the focus of the present work.

<h1> POP MUSIC IN BOLOGNA </h1>
<p>
Bologna and music constitute an inseparable pair. Bologna was one of the first cities spreading jazz culture in the country, but it is also home to the most important children's festival <i> Lo Zecchino D'Oro </i> . 
Bologna is arguably one of Italy's song-writing capitals, having inspired <b> Lucio Dalla, Francesco Guccini, Cesare Cremonini </b> and <b> Samuele Bersani </b> among others. 
Nevertheless, not only jazz, rock and hip-hop, but also Italian pop music owes Bologna a great deal.

<h1> OUR PROJECT</h1>
<p>
The present work is aimed at analysing pop bands phenomenon in Italy, with a particular focus on the <i>scena bolognese</i>.
A <b> corpus-based, diachronic approach</b> has been adopted: we chose a band emblematic of each decade, thus <b>Pooh</b> are representative of the <b>late 60's and 70's</b>. <b>Stadio</b> represent the <b>80's</b>. <b>Lunapop</b> are emblematic of <b>the late 90's and early 2000s</b>. Whereas <b>Lo Stato Sociale</b> is emblematic of the <b>2010's</b>.
Moreover, particular attention has been accorded to the works of <b>Cesare Cremonini</b>, Lunapop's frontman, in light of his impactful career on Italian pop music.
Moreover, a reflection has been conducted on the process of producing music, hence the study on <b>recording studios</b> who have inspired said artists. 
Not only have <b>theatres</b> always contributed to the cultural turmoil of the city, but they also represent a cherished venue for <i> bolognese </i> artists, hence, the study on theatres in Italy and in Bologna more specifically.
